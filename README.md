# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> Give an introduction to your repository here: Eg. This repository contains a complete implementation for ...

---

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

## 📁 Repository Structure

* Describe your repository structure here. Explain about overall code organization.

There are 4 files which are : main.py , algorithms.py , lab_endsem_report.pdf,main_1.py.
algorithms.py has implementation of 4 different models/methods
main.py has complete implementation of the best model that I got after hyper-parameter tuning. The training has been done one MNIST.train.csv and tested on MNIST.validation.csv, all the outputs are displayed in the main.py file itself.Please don't consider main_1.py file it is by mistake and I couldn't delete it.

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

* Mention all the related instructions for installation of related packages for running your code here.

usage of random , numpy , pandas, time , math ,collections has been done in the py files

## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

* Mention the instructions to run you .py files.
  
just press run and both should run

## You can further add your own sections/titles along with corresponding contents here
The code is ready to run in the 2 py files, Download  MNIST_train.csv and MNIST_validation.csv and read them using pandas.

## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
